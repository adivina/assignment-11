Up until now we have been using JavaScript in the environment of the browser. 
Node.js is a special program, a special environment, in which we can run JavaScript code without a browser.
We could use Node.js to set up a virtual server on our computer to test our JavaScript programs.
We could run HTTP servers and make HTTP requests. 
On top of server functionality, Node.js along with NPM repository adds additional functionality to JavaScript via modules.
